1) Is there a fault in the program? If so, locate it and explain.
	A) Yes. In the for-loop, the i counter starts at 1. It should start at i = 0

2) Define a test case that does not execute the fault. Start from this question,
if it is possible, you should give the test case (the attendance record with
10 values), the expected output and the actual output. If impossible, explains
the reason. Besides, you should implement the complete program, including the
functions under test, and verify your inputs along with their corresponding
outputs.
	A) It's not possible. The fault is always executed regardless of the input.

3) Define a test case that executes the fault but does not result in an error state.
	A) [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

4) Define a test case that results in an error state but not a failure.
	A) [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

5) Define a test case that results in failure.
	A) [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
